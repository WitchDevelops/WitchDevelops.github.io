This project was developed during the FreeCodeCamp web development bootcamp, based on their prompts. The design and coding are my own.

First, I designed how the page would look like in Figma:

Then I coded it in VS Code and deployed to GitHub pages.

This project features:
- responsive design,
- accessibility features (alt text),
- visual effects: vignette around the background images, text shadow colour, consistent color palette,
- hover and active states for links,
- custom icon for a browser tag.
