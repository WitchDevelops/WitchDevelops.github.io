# About

this is a landing page project. It follows the principles of a landing page layout:

a) above the fold elements:
1. Title (explains the service)
2. Subtitle (elaborates on how this service is delivered)
3. Call to action (addressing objections)
4. Social proof (build credibility and bandwagon effect) - this I don't have
5. Visual (show the product in action)

b) below the fold elements:
1. Features and objections
2. More social proof  - I have this in a form of social media icons, it's not the same
3. FAQ
4. Second call to action
5. Founders note - I don't have this yet

# Design
I started my design with mobile first. Once it is coded, I will adjust it for bigger screens.
