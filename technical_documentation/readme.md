# About
It's a technical documentation page about responsive web design. I created it from scratch (content, layout, color scheme, coding) in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The main focus here wasn't the page content, so it is not perfect, but it can serve as a quick guide to responsive web design principles. 

The main goal of this project was to practice my frontend skills, learn how to implement JavaScript into HTML pages (getElementById), and to practice CSS animations.

# Features
- hamburger menu that stays always on top (created with CSS)
- animation for the menu (CSS)
- inner links to page sections
- responsive design
- media queries with the menu on the left for desktop and hidden for mobile and tablet
- unit converter (JavaScript).

# Comments
I tried using Bootstrap and jQuery for the menu, but it didn't look right (menu items weren't visible). 
The CSS code for the animated menu was adapted from https://codepen.io/erikterwan/pen/EVzeRP.
The JavaScript code was adapted from https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_pxtoemconversion.asp.
