Technical documentation page created from scratch (content, layout, color scheme, coding) in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Features:
- hamburger menu that stays always on top (created with CSS)
- animation for the menu (CSS)
- inner links to page sections
- responsive design
- media queries with the menu on the left for desktop and hidden for mobile and tablet
- unit converter (JavaScript).

I tried using Bootstrap and jQuery for the menu, but it didn't look right (menu items weren't visible). 
The CSS code for the animated menu was mainly copied from CodePen https://codepen.io/erikterwan/pen/EVzeRP.
The JavaScript code was adapted from https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_pxtoemconversion.asp.
